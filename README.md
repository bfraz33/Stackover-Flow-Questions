# Stackover-Flow-Questions
My goal here is to show a basic Progression and degression of questions asked on programming languages on stack overflow. This shows how much programmers, developers and your day to day John Q relied on this site for information in the 2000's, 2010's and early 2020's. There is a drastic drop off in inquiries in the past 2-3 years with the creation and public availability to AI like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot and others.

I have written a python script to connect to kaggles API, place the flat file into an AWS S3 bucket. This then loads into my Snowflake DB, from there I'm loading this into PowerBI to create a basic visualization. I chose Python and SQL cluster column charts at the top, as this is what I used and probably the two most common languages used among DE's and Analysts.
